# Secure Chat
An AES-256 encrypted chat app

## What?
It is a basic version of my [discord clone](https://github.com/jackwellerreal/chat) where you can enter a key and view all messages that can be decrypted with that key.

## Why?
Me and my friend didn't trust our school provided email to communicate when in different classes from one another. We could't use signal because our school blocks it, so I created this.

## How?
The chat uses AES-256 encryption and the data is stored on a [firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore).
